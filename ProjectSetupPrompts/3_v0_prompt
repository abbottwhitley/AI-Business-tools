I need your help creating a MVP for a real estate offer application that I'm working on and I would like your help to initially build out the UI for the offer list view and the offer detail view that I have provided. Once we have focused on building out the UI and actually have it looking nice, we will later come back and start adding in functionality to actually make the application work. Do you have any questions before we begin?
